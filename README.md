  <h2>About Me</h2>
</p>
I am a data scientist, which to me, means someone who loves applying mathematics and programming to challenging questions facing humanity.

I received a BS in Mathematics (2020) and MS in Economics (2023) from the University of Nevada, Reno. 

Currently, I am a labor economist in the research bureau of Nevada's Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation.
